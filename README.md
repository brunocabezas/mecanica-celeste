## Development

This is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) after [ejecting](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject). [react-graph-vis network module](https://github.com/crubier/react-graph-vis) is used as main visualization library.

[Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org) is the tool used to build to production and serves app on a development env.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and deployment purposes.

### Installing

```
npm install
```

### Development server

```

```

_Linting_ (with [airbnb config]('.eslintrc.json')) is possible by running:

```

```

### Build
